# AUTH-Sheep
Official repo for the paper "_AUTH-Sheep: An Annotated Video Dataset for Detection and Tracking of Sheep in UAV Imagery_". 
The repo contains the new annotations for SheepCounter and some scripts that can be useful. AUTH-Sheep will be published later on.

AUTH-Sheep is an video dataset for detecting and tracking sheep in UAV imagery. 
The dataset consists of 4 videos with a total length of 2:58 min. 
In includes 4 classes (sheep, goat, human, and horse) and a total of 152,837 annotated object instances. 
The annotations include oriented bounding boxes (OBB) and track IDs. 
The track IDs are consistent per video, even after occlusion or reentering the frame. 

Additionally we created new oriented bounding box annotations for the raw version of the [SheepCounter dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/riisprivate/sheepcounter/dataset/11).
