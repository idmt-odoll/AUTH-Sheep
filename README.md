# AUTH-Sheep
Official repo for the paper "AUTH-Sheep: An Annotated Video Dataset for Detection and Tracking of Sheep in UAV imagery". The repo contains the dataset with annotations and some evaulation scripts.

AUTH-Sheep is an video dataset for detecting and tracking sheep in UAV imagery. The dataset consists of 4 videos with a total length of 2:58 min. In total there are 4 classes (sheep, goat, human, and horse) and a total of 152,837 annotated object instances. The annotations include oriented bounding boxes (OBB) and object IDs. The object IDs are consistent per video, even after occlusion or exiting and reentering the frame. 

Additionally we created new oriented bounding box annotations for the raw version of the [SheepCounter dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/riisprivate/sheepcounter/dataset/11).


IMPORTANT NOTE: The data set will be available until the paper is published.
